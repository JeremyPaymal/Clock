##  Demo: https://c-l-o-c-k.netlify.app/

## Description:
<hr>
This Website is a classic Clock Web App.

For this app, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Why create this app ?
<hr>
As a new and novice front end web developer, I practice my skills everyday.
I'm actually working on my skills with Javascript so it was a good way to do it.

<br>

## What kind of improvement can you add ?
<hr>
It's a simple app, the only improvement I want to do now is to make it responsive.
